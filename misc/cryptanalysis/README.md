### sg41/cryptanalysis

This is an implementation of a naive, brute-force wheel-setting algorithm.

It employs the use of some questionable search-space reduction algorithms, so, if it produces unexpected results, please do let me know! Define the preprocessor macro `DISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` at compile-time to disable the optimizations.
